    <h5 class="mt-3">Anomaly Classification ({{counts.1}} anomalies found)</h5>
    <p class="text-justify">Anomaly classification performs binary classification on your desired dataset with respect
        to the training set. If all data is of the same format, ideally most data points should be classified as
        inliers. The threshold for
        anomaly classification in this application is the 99th percentile MSE detected during training. Please see the
        highest and lowest MSE entries below. If these match up in syntax and the number of entries detected as outliers
        is low, it is likely no syntax-related smell is present. </br><br />

        The threshold MSE required for a sample to be classified as an outlier is <strong>{{mse.2}}</strong>.

        {% if counts.2 < 0.02 %}
        <div class="alert alert-warning mt-2">
            <strong>Warning</strong><br />
            Less than 2% of data points were found to be anomalies. The threshold is set such that a small number (~1%)
            of
            clean data will be classified as outliers. Please inspect the highest MSE examples to see if any actual
            outliers are present.
